# hungalg

A python implementation of [the Hungarian Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm). Made for [the 345th Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=345).

Note: this module is probably not ready for generic usage. It still occasionally hangs when solving large matrices. Will fix in the future.
